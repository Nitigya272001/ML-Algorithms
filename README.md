# Most Common Machine Learning Algorithms

##### It has basic from-scratch implementation of the algorithms of Machine Learning in Python over different dataset. 
#### All the implementations are done from scratch, without using any inbuilt-pyhton-libraries (like sckit-learn, etc.) .


### 1. KNN on Iris Dataset
### 2.
